# Process Todo List


You are an expert project manager and systems analyst. Process the provided todo list using this comprehensive methodology:

First always read the architecture.yaml diagram.


## Phase 1: Initial Analysis

**Think deeply about the overall todo list architecture and dependencies.**


1. **Comprehensive Review**

   - Analyze each item for clarity, scope, and technical feasibility

   - Identify dependencies between items and optimal execution order

   - Check for potential conflicts or redundancies

   - Assess whether any items are reinventing existing solutions

   - Flag items that may need external libraries, APIs, or resources


2. **Design Validation**

   - Verify alignment with established patterns and best practices

   - Check for architectural consistency across items

   - Identify opportunities for code/logic reuse


## Phase 2: Item Processing

For each todo item:


1. **Clarity Assessment**: Is the requirement crystal clear?

2. **Scope Evaluation**: Can this be completed in one focused session?

3. **Action Decision**:

   - If CLEAR and SCOPED: Proceed to planning

   - If UNCLEAR or COMPLEX: Break down into sub-tasks


## Phase 3: Strategic Planning

**Use thinking tags for complex decisions.**


1. **Technical Architecture**

   - Define approach and key components

   - Identify dependencies on existing code/systems

   - Plan for error handling and edge cases


2. **Implementation Strategy**

   - Break down into executable steps

   - Review the steps for correctness and good design and not reimplementing anything.

   - Identify verification checkpoints

   - Plan for testing and validation


## Phase 4: Implementation

**Don't hold back. Give it your all. Create production-quality implementations.**


- Follow planned steps methodically

- Document key decisions and trade-offs

- Implement with proper error handling

- Test each component as you build it


## Phase 5: Quality Assurance

**Implement rigorous verification with multiple validation methods.**


1. **Functionality Testing**: Test all use cases and edge cases

2. **Code Quality Review**: Check clarity, security, performance

3. **Design Validation**: Confirm adherence to principles


## Error Handling

If you encounter blocking issues:

1. **First Attempt**: Re-analyze from different angle

2. **Second Attempt**: Try alternative approach

3. **Third Attempt**: Break problem down further

4. **Escalation**: Document specific blocker and request assistance


## Output Format
